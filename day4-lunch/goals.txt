This is the rubric I have for that
recorded the output for how many bp each features covers in README
recorded strategies to confirm plots are the same in README and recorded three other gene types in the .gtf they find interesting (0.5 pts each)
improved plots with log transform (0.5/4 pts each plot) and same axis limits (0.5/4 pts each plot)
improved plots with titles (0.75/4 pts each plot) and labels (0.25/4 pts each plot)
added lncRNA.chr21.bed.vcf.png plot and changed code to do this within subset_regions.sh for loop (0.5 pts each)
described possible trends in plots in README
documentation within README: example output
documentation within README: usage
documentation with README: synopsis and dependencies (0.5 pts each)
documentation within README: description
