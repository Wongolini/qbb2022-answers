The website says to submit the following things:

1. A README file including any questions you had about this exercise, as well as the command you ran for Part 2 and your answers for the questions in Part 2
2. Your script for Part 1
3. At least one plot demonstrating your modelâ€™s performance from Part 1
4. Your plotting script for Part 2
5. The correlation plot for Part 2

I don't see a response to the Part 2 questions "Are the predictions different, or the same? Are there any trends that you notice looking at the data?
Looking at the xpresso_predict.py script you downloaded, why do you think the predictions may differ?" in the README

I see your script for Part 1 in the directory "clothing neural net", "part1.py" --> +2

I see two plots for 3 in the directory "clothing neural net" --> +2

I see 4 "parse_xpresso_predictions.py" --> +2

I see 5 "homework10.png" --> +2

8/10. Provide answers to the questions for a full 10/10. Is there an assignment you would like to replace?
