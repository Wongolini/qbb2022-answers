Great work, Nick! This almost perfect, there are just a couple of things we still need:
1. We had asked for the PCA both before and after filtering, just so we can visualize the affect of filtering. (-1 point) That said, really nice doing your own filtering. It looks like you essentially reproduced the Zheng17 recipe on your own, which is great!
2. Your support plots for part 4 are all excellent. Now we just want you to put all that together and reproduce the tSNE (or UMAP) with the clusters labeled based on the cell-types you assigned them. You have almost all the code set up already to do this, you just need to make the plot (-1.5 points)

Great work overall.
