Great work overall Nick! This all looks pretty good, I do just have a few comments:
1. I'm not entirely sure how you got 4 bins... Wondering whay assembly you used, because as far as I can tell, the rest of your alignment code looks correct. (no points deducted)
2. One thing I've noticed in general about your submissions is that it seems like you're generally more comfortable using python than bash. As someone who also came from a python background, I totally get it. That said, a lot of the times, I think it's faster and easier to type up basic scripts in bash. If there's something you're doing that's essentially a string of different command line tools, you can probably put that in a bash script. If I'm off the mark here, my apologies, but I do think it is worth the effort to build some confidence with bash scripting if you don't already feel like you have it.

Great work altogeher though!
