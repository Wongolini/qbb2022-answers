# day 5 lunch feedback

The scatter plot for number of maternally derived mutations does not match with my expectations. The number of mutations is much higher than I would expect

None of the included histograms answer the question (asking you to show the distributions for the number of paternally derived dnm per proband and the number of maternally derived dnm per proband (on the x-axis) with the frequency or number of probands with that number on the y-axis)

Overall, all statistical tests don't match with my expectations, so I think there is an issue with reading in and manipulating the data, however, I did not look deeply into the code to figure out where specifically the error is occurring. Happy to help troubleshoot if you have specific questions or concerns
