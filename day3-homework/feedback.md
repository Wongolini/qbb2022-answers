# Feedback day3-homework

Overall this looks good. You ex3 plotting code looks good and your plots look correct. While not required, it is nice if you include the commands you ran on the command line to do these data manipulations. Think of it as showing your work. You are missing the script for ex2 and the repsonse to the ex2 question. But all in all, well done. Keep it up!
